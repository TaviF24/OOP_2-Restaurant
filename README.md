# Restaurant

## Description
This OOP project is about how a restaurant is working. In this project, I had to hit different points:
- separating the code into ```.h``` and ```.cpp``` files
- inheritance: minimum a base class with 2-3 derived classes
- upcasting
- dynamic cast
- (pure) virtual function
- virtual constructors
- copy constructor and overloading = operator
- exceptions: minimum two classes derived from ```std::exception``` for errors( using ```throw``` in constructor/ ```try/catch``` in main)
- STL
- using ```const``` as much as possible
- having an interactive menu

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The project is not finished, the menu has to be done. Maybe I will continue it in the future.

## What I used
- MacOS
- CLion 2022.3.2
- C++
